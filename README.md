## About Me

I am a Junior Software Engineer focused on building full-stack skills and mastering agile practices to prepare for a larger impact in tech. My journey into software engineering began with a love for gaming, which inspired my curiosity about how computers work. This led me to start assembling computers and dream of creating my own games. Over time, my passion for technology expanded, and I began diving into software engineering through formal study.
